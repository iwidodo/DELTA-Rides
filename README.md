# DELTA-Rides
Delivery Transportation Algorithm for Ridesharers Research Project

This project is culmination of 3 years of research and development by Imam Widodo and Ertugrul Oksuz 
of an algorithm that solves a routing-optimization problem for carpoolers. Attached to the main page 
is a research paper and a presentation detailing our problem, the logic behind our algorithm, which 
is a modified GreedyRandomised Adaptive Search Procedure, and how it works. It was developed within 
the Eclipse Java IDE. Please feel free to message me if you have any questions about this project or 
have any suggestions.
