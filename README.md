# DELTA-Rides
Delivery Transportation Algorithm for Ridesharers Research Project

This project is culmination of 3 years of research and development by Imam Widodo and Ertugrul Oksuz of an algorithm that solves a routing-optimization problem for carpoolers. Attached to the main page is a research paper and a presentation detailing our problem, the logic behind our algorithm, which is a modified Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedure, and how it works. Our code can be found within the src/minDistance folder and our example test cases can be found within the inputs folder. It was developed within the Eclipse Java IDE. Please feel free to message me if you have any questions about this project or have any suggestions.
